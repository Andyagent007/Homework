          Exercise 1.3: Define a procedure that takes three numbers
          as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two
          larger numbers.

          <div class="answer-content">
            When first attempting to solve this exercise, I all the logic inside
            one procedure. It looked like this:
            <pre><code>
              (define (add_larger_sqrs a b c)
                (if (> a b)
                    (if (> b c) (sum-of-squares a b)
                        (sum-of-squares a c)
                    )
                (if (> a c) (sum-of-squares b a)
                    (sum-of-squares b c))
                )
              )
            </code></pre>
            After analyzing the code, it was too repetitive, and the intent of the code was obscured by the nested if statements. I was using 4 times
            the sum-of-squares function. Here is a re-factoring that more clearly expresses the goal of the code.
            <pre><code>
              (define (two_largest_numbers a b c)
                (if (> a b)
                  (if (> b c) (list a b)
                    (list a c)
                  )  
                  (if (> c a) (list b c)
                      (list a b)
                )  
              ))
              (define (add_largest_sqrs a b c)
                (apply sum-of-squares (two_largest_numbers a b c)))

          <div class="answer-content">
            In order to analyze the behavior of: 
            <pre>
              (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
                ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
            </pre>
            Consider a simpler example: 
            <pre>
              (define (a-plus-b a b)
                 (+ a b))
            </pre>
            The + operation is clearly visible; the point of the exercise is to 
            observe that in the a-plus-abs-b procedure (a.k.a. function) the
            actual operation performed is not a simple + or -, but is something
            determined by the compound expresion (if (> b 0) + -).

          Exercise 1.5: Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to 
          determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using 
          applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines 
          the following two procedures:

          <div class="answer-content">
            In order to solve this exercise we analyze how the procedure would 
            be intrepreted using normal-order evaluation:
            <pre><code>
              (test 0 (p))
              (if (= 0 0) 0 (p))

              As we see in the example above, the normal-order evaluation 
              doesn't care the value of p. It just gives the answer of 0. 
              However, let's now do the applicative-order evaluation for this 
              expresion.

                This code causes an infinite loop. Below is what it looks like 
                at the bottom of the screen when I run the code using DrRacket. 
                This shows the first 10 seconds of what I see when I run the 
                code (the video loops).

          friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
          defines a new version of if:

          <div class="answer-content">
            This version of square root with the new-if procedure instead of
            using the special form if, would still be as accurate as the first
            version. However, it is going to be slower, than the one that uses
            the directly the if, because a special form only analyze the
            alternative of the predicate, IF only the predicate is FALSE. On the
            other hand a procedure will (no matter what) analyze all the
            operands, this resulting in a much slower program.
