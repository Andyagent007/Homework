                    A computer would be able to answer the question,

                    because the computer would give more porcentage that is a cat than that is a dog, 
                    because it will look for a list of steps that have on the data and would find more similar with the traits of a cat and maybe some other traits that have on common with the dog and some others traits that have just a cat, 
                    then it would inclined more to the side of a cat than a dog.

                In the xy-plane the red curve is the graph of some anonymous function,

                Does the tangent line have a positive or negative slope?  
                Approximately what is the slope of that line?  Explain.

                The images show the chapter6 that teach you how to use the <span class="code">flex-shrink</span>,
                and what’s going on is that the goo zombies and the crossbow range 
                (The box that has a white solid border, don’t confuse it with the one that has the diagonal lines) shrink automatically. 
                To defeat the goo zombies we use <span class="code">flex-shrink</span>, 
                because they shrink as you can see in the second image.
                <span class="code">flex-shrink</span> works with a number with a non-negative number: 
                if the goo zombies shrink at the same time, it means that they all are shrinking in one, 
                if there is a goo zombie that shrink more it means that is shrinking two times more faster then is shrinking in 2, 
                and so.

                100 and 41 because 100*100-100+41=9959 and 41*41-41+41=1681 and those are not prime, 
                in fact I disprove that f(n) of the function f(x) = x² - x + 41,
