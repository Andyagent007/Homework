          The AaBbCc program
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
          You are given four integer values a, b, c and m.

          Check if there exists a string that contains:

          * a letters 'A';
          * b letters 'B';
          * c letters 'C';
          * no other letters;
          * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

          Input

          The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

          Each of the next t lines contains the description of the testcase — four integers a, b, c and m (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^8; 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^8).

          Output

          For each testcase print "YES" if there exists a string that satisfies all the requirements. Print "NO" if there are no such strings.

          You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

          Example:

          Input

          3
          2 2 1 0
          1 1 1 1
          1 2 3 2

          Output

          YES
          NO
          YES

          Notes:
          In the first testcase strings "ABCAB" or "BCABA" satisfy the requirements. There exist other possible strings.
          In the second testcase there's no way to put adjacent equal letters if there's no letter that appears at least twice.
          * a letters 'A';
          * b letters 'B';
          * c letters 'C';
          * no other letters;
          * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

          1 2 3 2

          Output

          YES
          NO
          YES

            MarkJam 3 
  
            For the Markjam 3, I couldn’t enter my game to the tournament, because I had some delays on the making of the game, but I was very excited to enter the game the Markjam, because I had a very base idea and illusions about the game I think it was going to be a great game, but I would’ve like to had more time to make the game and polish it well and also I experiment some new thinks like making my own sprites for the game, that I thought that was going to be easier than I though, but actually it was really difficult, also if I would finish the game in time and joined the game to the Markjam, it was going to be a new experience because, it was going to be the first time that I made a game that was going to played for someone else that wasn’t me, so that was is nice for me, because that way others persons would play my game and have opinion about the game, some good opinions and some bad but, that way I could developed my game with the critics of the persons, but I couldn’t have the enough time to make it so, I just thought that I wanted to finish the game, even if is not in the Markjam, because also it was and it is my first serious game, I want to give it dedication because, I have some good hopes and ideas for this game, so I’m going to finish the game anyways and now that I have an idea of how this is (the Markjam and all this kind of stuff) the next time I can do it better.

                This HTTP status code means that the server is processing the request that has received. 
                This status is to prevent that the client asume that the request is still processing and hasn’t been lost.

          Implement this programming language:
          <A href="https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Deque" style="color:#0ed4df;">https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Deque</A>.  
          So write a function called <span class='code'>dqInterpret(instructions)</span> that will take a string that contains instructions in this language, and then apply those instructions to an empty Dequeue, showing every step along the way.  
          For example, the wiki example starts with the instructions “3! !5 !2 sub! !add” and through a series of steps arrives at a Dequeue that looks like this: <span class='code'>[4]</span>.  
          It should show this:
          <ul>
            <li class='code'>
              []

          There is mathematical conjecture that says:  For any Jordan curve you can always find four points on it that can be connected to form a square.

          <p class="answer">ANSWER</p>
          <pre class="text" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
            Tim every year collect 30 lemons because he have 5 trees and get 6 lemons for every tree every year, so we multiply that result with 10 because is asking the lemons that he get in a decade and a decade are 10 years so we multiply the amounts of lemons that he get every year with the 10 years of a decade and the result is 300 lemons

            ---- These are the lemons that Tim collect every year
            5 * 6 = 30

            ---- Now that we now how many lemons Tim collect every year we multiply that to the 10 years of a decade
            30 * 10 = 300

            ----> Tim got 300 lemons every decade <----

          Anthony had 50 pencils.  He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, and he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.  He kept the remaining pencils.  How many pencils did Anthony keep?
        </p>
        <div class="answers">
          <p class="answer">ANSWER</p>
          <pre class="text" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
            He gave 1/2 of the 50 pencils to Brandon so that’s the half of the pencils, which is 25, now he just have 25 pencils and he gave 3/5 of the 25 pencils to Charlie that would be 15 of 25 pencils now he is just with 10 pencils left.

            To now how many pencils does Brandon have we multiply the 50 pencils of Anthony with the 1/2 that gave to Brandon
            ------ 50 * 1/2 = 25

            Now, we have to now, how many pencils does Anthony have left:
            
            ------ 50 - 25 = 25
            - Anthony have kept 25 pencils -

            Then he gave a 3/5 of his pencils so: 
            
            ------ 3/5 * 25 = 15
            - So he gave 15 pencils to Charlie -

            Now, hoy many pencils does Anthony have left?

            ------ First we add the total quantity of pencils that Anthony gave
            15 + 25 = 40 

            -And now we subtract that result to the original number of pencils that Anthony had:
            40 - 50 = 10 

            --------> Anthony have kept 10 pencils <--------
