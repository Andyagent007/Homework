          The AaBbCc program
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
          You are given four integer values a, b, c and m.

          Check if there exists a string that contains:

          * a letters 'A';
          * b letters 'B';
          * c letters 'C';
          * no other letters;
          * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

          Input

          The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

          Each of the next t lines contains the description of the testcase — four integers a, b, c and m (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^8; 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^8).

          Output

          For each testcase print "YES" if there exists a string that satisfies all the requirements. Print "NO" if there are no such strings.

          You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

          Example:

          Input

          3
          2 2 1 0
          1 1 1 1
          1 2 3 2

          Output

          YES
          NO
          YES

          Notes:
          In the first testcase strings "ABCAB" or "BCABA" satisfy the requirements. There exist other possible strings.
          In the second testcase there's no way to put adjacent equal letters if there's no letter that appears at least twice.
          * a letters 'A';
          * b letters 'B';
          * c letters 'C';
          * no other letters;
          * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

          1 2 3 2

          Output

          YES
          NO
          YES

          // Notes:

            MarkJam 3 
  
            For the Markjam 3, I couldn’t enter my game to the tournament, 
            because I had some delays on the making of the game, 
            but I was very excited to enter the game the Markjam, 
            because I had a very base idea and illusions about the game 
            I think it was going to be a great game, 
            but I would’ve like to had more time to make the game and polish it well and 
            also I experiment some new thinks like making my own sprites for the game, 
            that I thought that was going to be easier than I though, 
            but actually it was really difficult, 
            also if I would finish the game in time and joined the game to the Markjam, it was going to be a new experience because, 
            it was going to be the first time that 
            I made a game that was going to played for someone else that wasn’t me, so that was is nice for me, 
            because that way others persons would play my game and have opinion about the game, some good opinions and some bad but, 
            that way I could developed my game with the critics of the persons, but I couldn’t have the enough time to make it so, 
            I just thought that I wanted to finish the game, even if is not in the Markjam, because also it was and it is my first serious game, I want to give it dedication because, I have some good hopes and ideas for this game, so I’m going to finish the game anyways and now that I have an idea of how this is (the Markjam and all this kind of stuff) the next time I can do it better.

                This HTTP status code means that the server is processing the request that has received.

          There are simple examples online.  
          Write an explanation of how it works, and describe what were the most difficult parts of this exercise.

          <pre class='text'>
            The code is very similar to the <span class='code'>nodejs</span> one, the code first require express different as the <span class='code'>nodejs</span> that require <span class='code'>html</span> instead, then we make another constant that will invoque the express function, and then we designate the port. Then with the constant app that now is the function <span class='code'>express</span> we use <span class='code'>app.get</span> as an arraw function that is going to take two parameter, "req" that stands fot request and "res" that stands for response so we use <span class='code'>send</span> with the "res" parameter, that will return in the page what you put inside, in this case a string that says "Hello World!". And then we do <span class='code'>listen</span> that will listen to the port designated in line 3, then it will take an arrow funtcion that will print in the console "Example app listening on port ${port}" in this case ${port} is 3000.
          </pre>
          This is the code example:

            const express = require('express')
            const app = express()
            const port = 3000

            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
              res.send('Hello World!')
            })

            app.listen(port, () => {

          There is mathematical conjecture that says:  For any Jordan curve you can always find four points on it that can be connected to form a square.  
          Draw a non-trivial Jordan curve and show where you can put those four points to make a square.

            ---- These are the lemons that Tim collect every year

          <p class="answer">ANSWER</p>
          <pre class="text" style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
            He gave 1/2 of the 50 pencils to Brandon so that’s the half of the pencils, which is 25, 
            now he just have 25 pencils and he gave 3/5 of the 25 pencils to Charlie that would be 15 of 25 pencils now he is just with 10 pencils left.

            To now how many pencils does Brandon have we multiply the 50 pencils of Anthony with the 1/2 that gave to Brandon
            ------ 50 * 1/2 = 25

            Now, we have to now, how many pencils does Anthony have left:
            
            ------ 50 - 25 = 25
            - Anthony have kept 25 pencils -

            Then he gave a 3/5 of his pencils so: 
            
            ------ 3/5 * 25 = 15
            - So he gave 15 pencils to Charlie -

            Now, hoy many pencils does Anthony have left?

            ------ First we add the total quantity of pencils that Anthony gave
            15 + 25 = 40 

            -And now we subtract that result to the original number of pencils that Anthony had:
            40 - 50 = 10
