                    The AaBbCc program 
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
                            You are given four integer values a, b, c and m.

                            Check if there exists a string that contains:

                            * a letters 'A';
                            * b letters 'B';
                            * c letters 'C';
                            * no other letters;
                            * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

                            Input

                            The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

                            Each of the next t lines contains the description of the testcase — four integers a, b, c and m (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^8; 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^8).

                            Output

                            For each testcase print "YES" if there exists a string that satisfies all the requirements. Print "NO" if there are no such strings.

                            You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

                            Example:

                            Input

                            3
                            2 2 1 0
                            1 1 1 1
                            1 2 3 2

                            Output

                            YES
                            NO
                            YES

                            Notes:
                            In the first testcase strings "ABCAB" or "BCABA" satisfy the requirements. There exist other possible strings.
                            In the second testcase there's no way to put adjacent equal letters if there's no letter that appears at least twice.
                            * a letters 'A';
                            * b letters 'B';
                            * c letters 'C';
                            * no other letters;
                            * exactly m pairs of adjacent equal letters (exactly m such positions i that the i-th letter is equal to the (i+1)-th one).

                    This small bit of code packs quite a lot of functionality.  
                    For this question:  
                    Try to see if you can figure out what is going on to make the Stargate work.  
                    Play around with the code, change it in various ways, see if you can find some interesting variations.  
                    This is an open-ended question, so answer it as you like; but in general, play with the Stargate and report your thoughts, impressions, points of interest, or any other aspect of the code that you would like to write about.

                    Random nxn array function:
                    Write a function randomDigitArray(n) that takes a positive integer n.  
                    It generates an nxn array of random digits--numbers from 0 to 9--then creates an extra row by looking at the diagonal of the nxn array from upper left to lower right, copies those entries to the new row, then individually increments each of those numbers in the new row by 1, modulo 10.  
                    For example with n = 4, suppose it generates this random 4x4 array;
                    <pre class="code">
                        1038
                        2497
                        3568
                        1249
                    </pre>
                    Diagonal entries are

                    </pre>
                    So the final result is:

                    Question:  
                    Is it possible that the last row is equal to any of the rows above it, no matter how big n is?  
                    Explain.

                    "A topologist is a mathematician who doesn't know the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup."  
                    In seven steps show how you can transform a doughnut into a coffee cup the way that a topologist would:  
                    The rules are you can't poke hole into things, you can't tear things, and you can't close a hole completely if you have one.   
                    Otherwise you can stretch and bend and even enlarge the shape as much as you like.  So step one should be a coffee doughnut, and step seven should be a coffee cup.  
                    You can either draw the steps, or use clay (or similar) and take photographs.
