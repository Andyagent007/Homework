                    Look at the image called continued fraction.  
                    Sort of like an infinite repeated decimal, 
                    this is an infinite repeated fraction.  
                    Those three dots (the ellipsis) go on forever.  
                    But let’s calculate an approximation.  
                    Evaluate the expression as if the ellipsis has the value zero.  
                    Take a screenshot to show your work.  
                    You can do it in the JavaScript console with one expression and a whole bunch of parenthesis.

                    Along these lines, write a JavaScript program that will generate all permutations of the letters

                    So we should see <span class='code'>abcd</span>,

                    Write functions to play rock-paper-scissors.  
                    You’ll write three functions for the three players; 
                    use the following identifiers to name your functions:
                    <span class='code'>crisRPS</span>, <span class='code'>alexRPS</span>, <span class='code'>kennethRPS</span>.
                    Implement these any way you like, so long as they are capable of returning an object like this: 
                    <span class='code'>{name: 'cris', rps: 'scissors'}</span> — so in this example
                    <span class='code'>crisRPS</span> has been invoked, it tells it’s name (‘cris’), 
                    then its rock-paper-scissors value, in this case ‘scissors’.  
                    Use whatever strategy you like to generate the <span class='code'>rps</span> value.
                    Then write a second function <span class='code'>play(func1, func2)</span>
                    that takes two rock-paper-scissors functions and plays them against each other one time.  
                    It outputs an object like this <span class='code'>{players: 'cris vs alex', result: 'rock rock — draw'}</span>
                    or like this <span class='code'>{players 'cris vs alex', result: 'scissors paper — cris wins'}</span>.  
                    Play this game 10 times.
